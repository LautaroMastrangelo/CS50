# while going through digit by digit in a number, break condition must be number > 0
# x % 10 = last digit of X
# x / 10 = all digits except the last

# odd / 2 = floor of the divison (exp 11 / 2 = 5)
# while (*string) {remember to string++} will iterate until it founds the null character ("*" and "++" needed)
