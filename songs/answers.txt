basing of the information in the data base, the best way to characterize the aura of a listener is by averaging
the different information we have about the 100 songs, its tempo, speechiness, valece, etc

but I'd say that the best way to charactize a listener is by looking into the genres and artist of he's favorite and
most listened songs, so you can get an idea of which type of music he likes

(i hope my answer satifies the question, im not sure if i understood the question properly to be honest)
