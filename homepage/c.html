                As probably many people. I found C as one of the hardest programming languages, even if I've seen low leven on my university and it helped a lot.
                It was still a hard language to work with once we arrive to week 4, memory handling is not an easy task since you can barely seen whats happening
                behind the pc by using comments or debugging. <br>
                I have to admit it was a bit rough the last 2 weeks, but it doesn't change the fact that i didn't dislike it. It may not be my favorite language but
                i still enjoyed working at low level since it's a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite problem by far was wordle, before we arrive to this problem it was credit, but wordle was just so much fun, and i spend quite a few time playing
                it after finishing it, also I invite some friends to try it. <br>
                I also enjoyed other problems which involved memory and file handling, they were more challenging but less fun. So that's why i consider wordle as my favorite
                problem from C and from the course so far as my favorite
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center"> To be honest I saw you decided to delete it from the options in the practice and I felt a bit sad &lt/3, but well. I was able to make before it, so im happy about it </p>
