                The infamous python, I think everything i could say about this language was already said, personally the first time I used it was in this course, but soon after
                that I got really interested (I already knew a bit about python but after using it i got facinated) so i tried creating some scrips to automatize some daily task
                in some farming games to try it's potential and i was shocked of how easy and efective it was, almost everything I think about was already implemented, it was
                just a thing of searching for the right libraries using videos, google searching or some AI
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure that soon after I finish this course I will take the python cs50's one, because this language is just so amazing, so complete and so useful
            </p>
            <p> if I have to choose my favorite proyect it would be a bit easy since only one proyect were really made 100% in python an no transcripted from a C one, which is DNA
                a program not hard to implement but that turned a bit harder than expected. I think I did the whole python week in some hours because of how excited a was about it haha
