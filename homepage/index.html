        <main style="padding-left: 10px;">
            <p style="font-weight:bold;"> I'll start by introducing myself </p>
            <p>
                My name is Lautaro. I'm from Argentina and I'm currently studying at the "UNLP informatica" from Buenos Aires. <br>
                I just finished my first year and thanks to it I didn't found that hard the language C, which I personaly think is the hardest. <br>
                I joined cs50 because I am at holidays and i wanted to take a course in my free time, after some searching i decided for this one. <br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;"> I will also take some time to write about my opinion about my experience in cs50 so far.</p>
            <p>
                This course is just amazing, a lot of information for free, a lot of material to work with, an automatical check function, it's own AI, and lectures have even some fun parts on them. <br>
                To be honest i want to take cs50 python course too. I really like hardvard's virtual studying system and its teachers, they put a lot of effort in their work. especially David, he is such a great teacher<br>
                I started at december 2023, i made almost half of the course until 2024 when i saw you made some changes, which are very good to be honest. <br>
                For example merging labs and problem sets was a good call, it also helped me notice i accidentally skiped some problems
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>And last a picture of my university to share for you (and not because i wanted to ocupate more space of course...)</p>

<!-- it took me a long time to make the whole 4 pages but i manage to do it, was so much fun, i expected this task to be boring but i was wrong
since i found kinda hard to track all the html libraries i used ddb way more than usual, especially to develop the js game
(i still found element handling js->html kinda hard so i was lost in how to manage all of that)-->
